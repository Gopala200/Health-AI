🚀 Scenarios

✅ Scenario 1 – Symptom-based Disease Prediction

A user reports symptoms like persistent headache, fatigue, and mild fever.
HealthAI analyzes the symptoms along with the patient’s profile to predict potential conditions, assign likelihood scores, and recommend next steps (consultation, rest, or tests).

✅ Scenario 2 – Personalized Treatment Plans

A user inputs a diagnosed condition into the Treatment Plans generator.
HealthAI provides a comprehensive plan including medications, lifestyle modifications, and follow-up testing recommendations.

✅ Scenario 3 – Health Trends & Analytics

A user accesses the Health Analytics dashboard to track vital signs over time.
The system visualizes trends (e.g., rising blood pressure) and generates AI-driven insights and health improvement tips.
